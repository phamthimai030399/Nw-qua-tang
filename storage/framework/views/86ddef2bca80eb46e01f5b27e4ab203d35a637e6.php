                    Company's strategy is to manufacture tires in the country where
                    they will be sold whenever possible. In fact, the vast majority
                    of their products sold in North America, are built in the 21
                    plants they have across the United States, Canada and Mexico,
                    employing most of the 23,000 employees of Michelin North
                    America, Inc. However, BFGoodrich is an international company,
                    with manufacturing operations at 74 plants across 19 countries
                    around the world. To meet the needs of customers by providing
                    more specialized tire lines in smaller quantities, they import
                    some tire lines into North America and export others from North
                    America.
